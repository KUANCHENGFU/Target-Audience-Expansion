# Target Audience Expansion

## Overview
The goal of this project is to propose a framework to expand target audience by scraping LinkedIn and Glassdoor using **Selenium** and **Beautiful Soup**. This project is basically composed of three parts as follows:
1. Perform a specific Google search query to find company profiles on LinkedIn or Glassdoor
2. Extract the URL of each company profile from each Google search page
3. Extract the desired data, such as company name, website, and industry, from each URL
