    "We decided to explore reliable AI or data processes to unpdate the information of a given target audience list and meanwhile expand the list for more companies in the similar industry. However, to be honest, we still haven't figure out the best way to solve the problem. Therefore, in this proposal, I will demonstrate an intuitive method to try to solve the problem by utilizing Google's search engine and two scraping tools, including Selenium and BeautifulSoup. Althought this method is simple and intuitive and might has some limitations, I believe that the concept of this method is applicable for several potential data sources and might be the inspiration for our next step."

The search query **site:www.glassdoor.com/Overview/ AND \"coffee\" AND \"Europe\"** will return 9-10 company profiles on Glassdoor per page. Second, we will extract the URLs of each company profile on each page. In this example, we will extract the URLs from only two pages. Last, we will extract the desired data, including company name, website, size, and industry, from each URL. After that, We will store all the data into a dataFrame named **df_glassdoor**."

The search query **site:www.linkedin.com/company/ AND \"coffee\" AND \"Europe\"** will return 9-10 company profiles on LinkedIn per page. Second, we will extract the URLs of each company profile on each page. In this example, we will also extract the URLs from only two pages. Last, we will extract the desired data, including company name, website, and industry, from each URL. After that, We will store all the data into a dataFrame named **df_linkedin**."

    "As mentioned in Chapter 1, the proposed method seems not the best way to solve the problem. However, on the basis of chapter 2, I believe that the concept of this method is intuitive and applicable for other potential data sources such as Indeed and Monster. Moreover, if we decide to keep developing the proposed method, I think there are several issues needed to be further discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If we decide to rely on several different data sources, then we probably have to make sure whether our final target audience list is going to be the union or intersection of the lists from each data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Since the information of companies from each data source, except LinkedIn, might not contain LinkedIn URLs, we probably need to perform specific search queries, including company name, website, and industry, on Google's search engine in order to get the LinkedIn URLs. Howerver, the accuracy might be questionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. According to Chapter 1, another challenging issue is how to unpdate the information of a given target audience list. Similarly, we could still rely on Google's search engine. However, as the previous point illustrates, the accuracy might be questionable and we might still need to check the updated list in person."
